A record is a collection of data items relating to a particular entity.

For example someone may wish to store data about cars. ‘Car’ is the entity.
The data items to be stored about each example of a ‘Car’ could be:

- Make
- Model
- Colour
- Power

Each item of data is called a field.

There could be many more.

Most programming languages allow a record data structure to be set up and each item must be assigned a particular data type.
An advantage of using records is that different data types can be stored in each record whereas in most languages array items must be of the same one.
